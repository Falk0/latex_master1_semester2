\section{Texture mapping}
Texture mapping allows us to add more detail without adding more geometry. In this lecture will the following techniques be presented:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Texture mapping
		\item Displacement mapping
		\item Bump and normal mapping
		\item Environment mapping
		\item Procedural textures
		\item Billboarding
	\end{itemize}


	\subsection*{Textures}
	In most real-time rendering is textures of image-based 2D arrays of data used. The textures can be created from photos or hand drawn images. There are also textures in 1D and 3D used in some applications. The elements of these textures are called texels, can hold many types of information such as: Colors, normals, opacity, intensity gloss, height and ambient occlusion for mentioning some.
